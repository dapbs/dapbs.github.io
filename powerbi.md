Is my sales performance good/bad? How good/bad? Why? What are we going to do about it?
Include variances (percentages); conditional formatting

1) Bad choice of charts
- Type
- Orientation
- Advanced (variances, categories)

If you see labels displayed diagonally something is wrong. Tilt your head!? Turn the chart 90 degrees.
Exception Time - flows left to right. Most everything else, vertical.

Pie chart > Bar chart

2) Poor labeling
(otherwise need to mouse over)
(Not too many!)
If possible, use short labels (January > Jan) to increase readibility.

3) Excessive user of slicers
- Particularly problematic when slicers have many choices > consider dropdown
- Consider using a chart/table which can also be used to slice - use the space to present information AND slice

4) Inconsistent use of colors
* Look out for too many colors within a dashboard
  * Tree maps and stacked column chars usually problematic > use when there are few categories or replace with bar charts
* Same color represents different things
