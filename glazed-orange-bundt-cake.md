# Glazed Orange Bundt Cake

## Cake
- 3 cups (315g) sifted cake flour* (spooned & leveled)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup olive oil
- 1 cup granulated sugar (already reduced the original amount!)
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- zest from 2 oranges (about 2 packed Tablespoons)
- 1/2 cup (120ml) fresh orange juice

## Easy Orange Glaze
- 1 and 1/4 cups (150g) sifted confectioners’ sugar
- 2–3 Tablespoons (30-45ml) fresh orange juice
- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

## Instructions
1. Lower the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Spray the inside of a 10-inch Bundt pan with nonstick spray or grease thoroughly with butter. Set aside.
2. Make the cake: Whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together. Set aside.
3. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy – about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed for 2 minutes until creamed together. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the eggs and the vanilla. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in the orange zest and juice. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk and mixing each addition just until incorporated. Do not overmix. The batter will be slightly thick.
4. Pour/spoon the batter evenly into the Bundt pan. Bake for 45-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cover the cake loosely with aluminum foil if you begin to see the top browning quickly. Once done, remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes inside the pan.
5. Invert the slightly cooled Bundt cake onto a wire rack set over a large plate or serving dish. Allow cake to cool before glazing and serving.
6. Make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners’ sugar, 2 Tablespoons of orange juice, and vanilla together. It will be very thick. Whisk in 1 or more Tablespoons of juice, depending how thick you’d like the glaze. Drizzle over cake. Slice and serve.
