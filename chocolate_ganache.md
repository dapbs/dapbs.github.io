#Ingredients
4-ounce quality semi-sweet chocolate bars, finely chopped
(Used Guitard 70% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate)
1 cup (8 ounces; 240ml) heavy cream or heavy whipping cream

1. Place chopped chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to gently simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil– that’s too hot!) Pour over chocolate, then let it sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften the chocolate.
2. With a metal spoon or small rubber spatula, very slowly stir until completely combined and chocolate has melted. The finer you chopped the chocolate, the quicker it will melt with the cream.
