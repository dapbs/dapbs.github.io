##3D Printing
* Martin's note on [Jay Leno's use of 3D printing](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a4354/4320759/) to produce replacement auto parts reminded me of the Swedish hypercar manufacturer [Koenigsegg](https://www.koenigsegg.com/). I enjoyed [this YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88xdv5vzV9M&list=PLHa6PXrV-yIgnXSYFT07BouKhEhyFuWnf) focused on the brand's myriad innovations.
